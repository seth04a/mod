 Legacy_of_the_Saaremaa_Purge: "Legacy of the Saaremaa Purge"
 Legacy_of_the_Saaremaa_Purge_desc: "The brutal actions of the Estonian regime during the Saaremaa Purge have left an indelible mark on the island’s people. What began as an effort to quash dissent has only deepened the resolve of the rebels, turning a local uprising into a full-scale resistance movement. The heavy-handed tactics have sown hatred and distrust toward the government, with entire communities rallying to the cause. However, the scars run deep. While the purge has galvanized support for the revolt, it has also drained the island’s manpower and left many wary of sustained conflict, leading to instability and recruitment challenges."
